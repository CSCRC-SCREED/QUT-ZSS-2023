description: The Datasets contain a wide variety of network and physical behaviours in an IEC-61850-compliant zone substation.
             The datasets are compatible with actual substation network traffic, including both Generic Object-Oriented 
             Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Value (SV) network packets.
